# Project 2 : Dog breed prediction  using Tensorflow and Keras
Steps to solve the problem : 
    1) Load the data from Kaggle
    2) Load labels csv for labels that contain image id and breed 
    3) Check the breed count
    4) One hot-encoding on labels data prediction column
    5) Load the images , convert tehm into array, and normalize them 
    6) Check the shape and size of the x and y data 
    7) build the model network architecture 
    8) split the data and fit it into the model and create an accuracy plot 
    9) evaluate the model accuracy score
   10) use the model for prediction
